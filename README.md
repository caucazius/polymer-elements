## Running this code

1.  Download and install Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Node includes the node package manager command, `npm`.

2.  Install `bower` and `polyserve`:

        npm install -g bower polyserve

3.  Clone this repo

4.  Change directory to your local repo and install dependencies with `bower`:

        cd polymer-first-elements
        bower install

5.  To preview your element, run `polyserve` from the repo directory:

        polyserve

6. Open `localhost:8080/components/icon-toggle/app/` in your browser.


If you're wondering what `polyserve` does, see [Testing elements with local bower dependencies](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/reusableelements.html#local-dependencies)
